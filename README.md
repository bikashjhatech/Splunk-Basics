# Splunk-Basics

I completed the Splunk Basics course on TryHackMe, where I learned about key Splunk components such as the Forwarder, Indexer, and Search Head. I also gained hands-on experience navigating the Splunk GUI, adding data, and analyzing information to answer specific queries. Excited to continue building on this knowledge and explore more advanced features of Splunk.
